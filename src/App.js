          I'm a sad person. I have sad logs. Very sad logs. 
          </p>
          <p id='poem'>
          The weight of sorrow, heavy and deep
          A shadow that never seems to sleep
          Heartache that pierces like a knife
          Pain that consumes my every life
          </p>
          <p>
          Memories of what once was bright
          Now faded and lost in the night
          The emptiness that fills my soul
          Aching for something to make me whole
          </p>
          <p>
          Oh, how I long to be free
          From this sadness that's consuming me
          But for now, I'll bear this heavy load
          And hope that someday, I'll find the road.
